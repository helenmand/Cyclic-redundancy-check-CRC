# Cyclic-redundancy-check-CRC

The program simulates a communication system, where binary messages are transmitted through a noisy channel. It generates random binary messages, simulates errors using a noise model, and checks for errors using Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC). Eventually, it calculates the percentage of corrupted and detected messages.
